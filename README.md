Team 2 will construct 3 ArrayList<Integer> JCF Data Structures with capacities of (1) 20; (2) 2,000; & (3) 20,000 elements described in the Constructing Data Structures with TDD as described below. Team 2 will use the int[] arrays created by Team 1 to fill each ArrayList<Integer> (PART 1). Team 2 will then sort each Data Structure using the bubble sort and measure the Big O Notation efficiency using elapsed time, where the execution times are returned as longs (PART 2). Team 2 will then search each ArrayList<Integer> for the first 2 odd integers between 400 and 4,000 and measure the Big O Notation efficiency of this search using elapsed time (PART 3).
Team 2 will then post the required data as discussed below.

Team 2 Lead: Nikole Clarke

Dillon and Corey will work on PART 1.
Damian and Bryan will work on PART 2.
Robin and Nikole will work on PART 3.
